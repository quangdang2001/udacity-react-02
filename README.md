# MyReads Project

This project is designed to facilitate learning through Udacity. It focuses on mastering state management, event handling within components and Redux, as well as understanding how to effectively test React components using Jest. The primary objective of this project is to effectively manage a poll system for each user. Users can create their own polls, cast votes on existing polls, and access reports detailing poll results.

## Prerequisites

To run a React app, you'll need a few prerequisites in place. Here's a step-by-step guide on what you'll need:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):
  React is built using Node.js, so you'll need to install Node.js which includes npm, a package manager for JavaScript. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

## TL;DR

Running the React App

- Clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/quangdang2001/udacity-react-01
```

- Navigate to the Project Directory: <br>
  Change your current directory to the project directory you just created:

```bash
cd udacity-react-02
```

- Start the Development Server: <br>
  Run the following command to start the development server and launch the React app: <br>

```
npm install: in the project root directory to install dependency
```

```
npm start: to launch the project
```

This command will start the development server and automatically open your React app in a web browser. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source code.

Now you have your React app up and running! You can start building your application by editing the code in the src directory of your project.
